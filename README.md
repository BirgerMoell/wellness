A collection of resources relating to mental health

This is a collection of resources relating to mental health.

The goal is to give a complete list
of ways to deal with any mental health problem.

Above all else there is one guiding principle that will help you feel well.

Act.

Actions give us the momentum we need to move forward in our lives. It is often easier to change our course once we have started an action than it is to get started.

## Common tips for dealing with negative thoughts and emotions

## Writing

When we write we form a feedback loop from our mind which helps us let go of negative events and strengthen positive memories.

## Art

Art is a way to explore things within your unconscious mind. It is a therapeutic process that can help you overcome traumatic experiences and help us overcome low mood and remain happy. 

## Depression
One of the most common mental
health problems is depression.
It affects approximately 30% of
all adults in the world.

Symptoms of depression include low mood, negative thoughts and thoughts of suicide.

Depression is a state where the individual suffering believe that
the way they view the world and themselves is wrong. Strong negative
beliefs about themselves or the world, "I'm worthless", "There is no point", "The world is an evil place" might paralyze the person suffering from depression from performing actions that might improve their depression.

State depend memory is also a problem with depression. When we are depressed
we often only remember other times
when we are depressed and might wrongfully view our life history as a
list of failures.

Depression is present in all cultures. Risk factors include, social isolation, lack of physical exercise, bullying, alcohol or drug abuse, anxiety disorders, personality disorders and unemployment.

The most common treatments for depression is SSRI medication (antidepressants) and behavioral activation (therapy). Physical exercise and mindfulness meditation
has also been shown to be good ways to cope with depression.

### Behavioral activation
Behavioral activation works by
getting the patient to perform more activities in their life. The activities are often things that the
patients used to enjoy before they became depressed or/and physical exercise.

Behavioral activation is effective
because the mind is a machine for processing information. By receiving
more information more computations will be performed and it is more likely that our mind will release neurotransmitters such as dopamine that will heighten our mood.

## Anxiety disorders
Anxiety disorders can be thought
of as a collection of disorders
that all are related to a fear
responsive of the sympathetic
nervous system.

Although they are different, most
if not all anxiety disorders respond
well to cognitive behavioral therapy
and exposure therapy.

### Social phobia
Social phobia is the fear of interacting with other people.

Social phobia can be accompanied
by a lack of social skill, wherein
the disorder is worsened because
the individual hasn't learned
a good way to interact with
others that lessens anxiety
during the interaction.

In every interaction with another
human the other person has the potential to influence us. This can
be either good or bad so it is in a
way fairly natural to be vary of
other people.

The problem with this is since humans are social animals, so without interactions with other humans we
miss out on life and opportunities and
it might heighten our risk of suffering from other disorders such as
depression.

### Panic disorder
Panic disorder is a anxiety disorder
where the patient suffer from debilitating panic attacks and fear more panic attacks.

A panic attack is caused by hyperventilation during anxiety which
creates an imbalance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.

The level of oxygen in the blood is too high. This is caused by the body preparing for fight or flight while the person is stationery.

Too alleviate panic the sufferer needs
to focus on breathing slowly, expelling excess oxygen through the breath to create a balance between
carbon dioxide and oxygen within the
bloodstream.

### Obsessive compulsive disorder
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
is an anxiety disorder caused by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) that
forces the individual to perform
actions (compulsions) to alleviate the
anxiety caused by these thoughts.

Obsessive thoughts often relate to a belief that a catastrophic scenario will happen if the compulsion isn't completed.

If I don't check my door for the 40th time I might get robbed.

Most people often check things to a
certain degree. Before we travel
we often check our passport even though we are fairly certain that we have our passport with us.

Other forms of OCD are related to perfectionism and the idea that everything has to be perfect. This can lead to excessive cleaning.

### Post traumatic stress disorder
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is
an anxiety disorder that is caused
by a traumatic event such as sexual abuse, physical abuse, rape, torture, war, migration or bullying.

PTSD is one of the most problematic
psychiatric disorders because it is
directly related to memory which in turn is linked to cognition.

## Positive psychology
Positive psychology focus on what we should be doing once we feel fairly well.

This means, how should we live our lives once we overcome trauma and other mental problems to keep feeling good.

The people who criticise positive psychology might believe it is naive way and that there simply isn't possible to be happy all the time because all emotions should be part of a healthy life.

This belief is simply false. It is better to be happy then to be sad.

Because of privilege and upbringing
some people are more happy because
they have fewer negative memories and better ways to cope with negative emotions.

Life is fundamentally unfair. This sucks but it is something that you have to accept.

At the same time, everyone who made progress in any field made it in the same way. By their actions.
