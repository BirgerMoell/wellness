This is a collection of resources relating to mental health.

The goal is to give a complete list
of ways to deal with any mental health problem.


## Depression
One of the most common mental
health problems is depression.
It affects approximately 30% of
all adults in the world.

## Anxiety disorders
Anxiety disorders can be thought
of as a collection of disorders
that all are related to a fear
responsive of the sympathetic
nervous system.

Although they are different, most
if not all anxiety disorders respond
well to cognitive behavioral therapy
and exposure therapy.

### Social phobia
Social phobia is the fear of interacting with other people.

Social phobia can be accompanied
by a lack of social skill, wherein
the disorder is worsened because
the individual hasn't learned
a good way to interact with
others that lessens anxiety
during the interaction.

In every interaction with another
human the other person has the potential to influence us. This can
be either good or bad so it is in a
way fairly natural to be vary of
other people.

The problem with this is since humans are social animals, so without interactions with other humans we
miss out on life and opportunities and
it might heighten our risk of suffering from other disorders such as
depression.

### Panic disorder
Panic disorder is a anxiety disorder
where the patient suffer from debilitating panic attacks and fear more panic attacks.

A panic attack is caused by hyperventilation during anxiety which
creates an imbalance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.

The level of oxygen in the blood is too high. This is caused by the body preparing for fight or flight while the person is stationery.

Too alleviate panic the sufferer needs
to focus on breathing slowly, expelling excess oxygen through the breath to create a balance between
carbon dioxide and oxygen within the
bloodstream.

### Obsessive compulsive disorder
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
is an anxiety disorder caused by intrusive thoughts (obsessions) that
forces the individual to perform
actions (compulsions) to alleviate the
anxiety caused by these thoughts.

Obsessive thoughts often relate to a belief that a catastrophic scenario will happen if the compulsion isn't completed.

If I don't check my door for the 40th time I might get robbed.

Most people often check things to a
certain degree. Before we travel
we often check our passport even though we are fairly certain that we have our passport with us.

Other forms of OCD are related to perfectionism and the idea that everything has to be perfect. This can lead to excessive cleaning.
