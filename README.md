A collection of resources relating to mental health

This is a collection of resources relating to mental health.

The goal is to give a complete list
of ways to deal with any mental health problem.


## Depression
One of the most common mental
health problems is depression.
It affects approximately 30% of
all adults in the world.

## Anxiety disorders
Anxiety disorders can be thought
of as a collection of disorders
that all are related to a fear
responsive of the sympathetic
nervous system.

Although they are different, most
if not all anxiety disorders respond
well to cognitive behavioral therapy
and exposure therapy.

### Social phobia
Social phobia is the fear of interacting with other people.

Social phobia can be accompanied
by a lack of social skill, wherein
the disorder is worsened because
the individual hasn't learned
a good way to interact with
others that lessens anxiety
during the interaction.

In every interaction with another
human the other person has the potential to influence us. This can
be either good or bad so it is in a
way fairly natural to be vary of
other people.

The problem with this is since humans are social animals, so without interactions with other humans we
miss out on life and opportunities and
it might heighten our risk of suffering from other disorders such as
depression.
